## Project Index

* **Bike Sharing**: Predict bike rental demand with `caret` and `tidymodels` in R. The purpose is to demonstrate the differences between caret and tidymodels and how to integrate both packages to build predictive models.
  * [R script](Bike-Sharing/Bike-Sharing.R), [R Markdown](Bike-Sharing/Bike-Sharing.Rmd), or [HTML](https://yuenhsu.github.io/Machine-Learning-Projects/Bike-Sharing.html)
